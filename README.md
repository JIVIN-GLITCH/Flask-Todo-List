# Flask-Todo-List
*I have made a todo-list web application using html,css,javascript,flask and sql.  *Users can register by givin their username,email id ,name and age to use the app.  The username, email,name and age are stored in a table called customers(ran out of name :) ).The password is hashed using 'get-password-hash'.  *Upon registering,users can login to their account with their username and password.If the details are wrong,a message pops up otherwise they are logged in  *The users are then directed to the page showing their tasks.They can add more tasks or delete them using the options available on the page.  *There is also an option to edit their details  *If the users wants, he/she can delete their account from the application if they do not want to use the services anymore  *Finally they can logout and all their changes are saved.
